# 🚀 CC Tweaked: Experimentation and Fun

Welcome to **CC Tweaked**, a sandbox repository where I experiment, play around, and explore the endless possibilities of **ComputerCraft: Tweaked**. This is not a polished project—it's a playground for learning, testing, and having fun with Lua scripting in Minecraft!

## 🎮 What to Expect
- Random scripts and programs.
- Lots of testing and unfinished experiments.
- No guarantees of functional or bug-free code.
- A mix of small utilities, fun experiments, and possibly chaotic results.

## 📚 Purpose
This repository is my personal space for:
- Learning Lua and CC: Tweaked.
- Experimenting with automation, reactors, and turtle scripting.
- Trying out random ideas as they come to me.

If anything here turns out to be genuinely useful, I'll likely move it to a **dedicated repository** with proper documentation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- **Use at your own risk.**
- Don't expect polished or production-ready code.
- Most of this is experimental and might break... spectacularly.

## 🛠️ How to Use
Feel free to browse, borrow, or modify any of the scripts. Just keep in mind:
- Some scripts might be incomplete.
- Others might require specific setups (e.g., turtles, peripherals, or reactor configurations).

## 💡 Future Plans?
Who knows! I'll keep adding scripts and tweaking things as I learn more. Stay tuned—or don’t. This is mostly for me anyway. 😄

## 📬 Feedback
If you have suggestions, ideas, or just want to chat about CC: Tweaked, feel free to reach out!

Happy scripting! 🖥️✨
